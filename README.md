## Features: 

* ### GameBoard
    *  #### Tic-Tac-Toe
         I created the first version of this tic-tac-toe game prior to starting my software engineering immersive with General Assembly. Upon starting the SEI, I quickly saw that I had made some practical errors in implementing the game, so as a project I refactored the functionality using the principles and best practices I picked up at GA. Check out the gameboard at: https://traviscashion.com/gameboard.html. 
    *  #### Sudoku
